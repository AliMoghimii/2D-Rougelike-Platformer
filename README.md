# Platformer Rougelike Game \n
This project was one of my first game projects created in Unity, with the purpose of learning more about the engine, different game mechanics and simple enemy AI. \n

There are 2 different builds in this repo :
"\Stick Engine Dungeon generator\BasicPlatformer2D.exe" is the dungeon generator scene with a couple of rooms arranged to make a map. \n
"\Stick Engine Dungeon generator\Test levels\BasicPlatformer2D.exe" has a series of test stages with all of the current features available in this demo. \n
